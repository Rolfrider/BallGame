## BallGame
Here you can admire my project for event programming  classes on university. 

## How to start ?
To run this game you will need at least Jre8 and simply double-click the Ball.jar. The app is designed to work in Server-Client architecture, so you can also run server with Server.jar, but it works without server too. Please remember to set the IP address in client-config.xml. If you find any difficulties in launching the app try to open it in Intellj IDEA and build your own jar or play it form ide. The class to start is in App.Client package.
